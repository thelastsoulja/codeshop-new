SyliusGridBundle
================

Displaying a grid with sorting and filtering options is a common task
for many web applications. This bundle integrates the Sylius Grid
component with the Symfony framework and allows you to display grids
really easily.

Some of the features worth mentioning:

-   Uses YAML or PHP to define the grid structure
-   Supports different data sources: Doctrine ORM/ODM, native SQL query.
-   Rich filter functionality, easy to define your own filter type with
    flexible form
-   Each column type is configurable and you can create your own
-   Automatic sorting
